# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 3
# puts 5

# puts 3 + 5
# puts 3 * 5
# puts 3 - 5
# puts 3 / 5
# puts 3.0 / 5.025

# # Non-numbers

# puts "3 + 5"

# # True, False

# puts true
# puts false

# # Nothing

# # Variables
amount = 3
food = "Tacos"
# puts x
# puts y
# z = x * y
# puts x + y
# puts z

# #the variables are dynamic. You can reassign or redefine the variable (in Ruby)
# z = 99
# puts z


# Combine strings and variables
puts "#{food} on today's menu: #{amount}"
#puts x


# String manipulation
puts food.upcase
