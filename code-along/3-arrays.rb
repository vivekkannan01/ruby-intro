# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
# p foods

numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
# p numbers

mixed_stuff = ["tacos", 3, true]
# p mixed_stuff 

# Accessing the array
# puts foods [0]
# puts foods [1]
# puts foods [2]
# puts foods [3].inspect #null or nil
# puts nil
# puts ""
# puts nil == ""

# Add to the array
# shopping_list = foods + ["eggs"]
# foods.push "eggs"
# p shopping_list
# p foods

shilohs_list = ["toys", "pullups"]
foods.push(shilohs_list)
p foods
p foods [3][1]
